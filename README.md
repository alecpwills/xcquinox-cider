Tools for training and evaluating CIDER functionals for use in Density Functional Theory calculations

## What is the CIDER model?

Machine Learning (ML) has recently gained attention as a means to fit more accurate Exchange-Correlation (XC) functionals for use in Density Functional Theory (DFT). We have recently developed the CIDER model, a set of features that efficiently describe the electronic environment around a reference point in real space and can be used as input for ML-XC functionals. **CIDER** stands for **C**ompressed scale-**I**nvariant **DE**nsity **R**epresentation, which refers to the fact that the descriptors are invariant under squishing or expanding of the density while maintaining its shape. This property makes it efficient for learning the XC functional, especially the exchange energy.
